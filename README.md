Gentrification Prediction Application.
Created during Nashville's 2014 Hack4Change in 36 hours.
Won 3rd place.
Team consisted of 5 Nashville Software School students.


The difficulty in creating this application was the concept and logic behind defining gentrification. After creating a clear definition of gentrification, 3 different APIâ€™s were used to calculate the areas prime for gentrification in Nashville.
     - Nashville Open Data Set on Building Permits
     - Census Data
     - Google Maps


My responsibilities on this project:
     - Team lead
     - Managed the communication and work flow between all team members
     - Contributed to coding the backend of the application
